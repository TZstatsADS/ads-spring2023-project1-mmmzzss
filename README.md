### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: Data story - The History of Feminism
+ This project is conducted by Jingshu Zhang

+ Project summary: It is widely discussed in 2023 that the inequality between men and women is around everywhere in terms of salary and job opportunities in the workplaces, the political movement, and so on. Feminism has the position that male point of view is prioritized, and for most of the time, females are treated in an unjust way. This story looks into three authors, Wollstonecraft, Davis, and Beauvoir with regards to their attitudes and emotions towards feminism. The analysis is compiled based the History of Philosophy dataset on Kaggle.




The outline of the data story:

1. EDA on the Whole dataset
  - 1.1 Frequency of Publication across School and Author
  - 1.2 Compound Score with Sentiment Analysis across School
 
2. EDA - concentration on Feminism
  - 2.1 Contribuition of authors in Feminism
  - 2.2 Sentiment Analysis across Authors
  - 2.3 Emotions Analysis across Author
  - 2.4 WordCloud of 3 authors
 
3. Future work
